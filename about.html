		<h2> Our Story </h2>

		<blockquote> <i> 

			Founded by Dr. Samuel Parr of John Hopkins University in 2015, Grab n' Go was intended to be the go-to spot for commuters. Feeling hungry while driving to work one day, decided to stop by a McDonald's drive-thru for breakfast. His experience was less than satisfactory, but it gave him an epiphany. What if a drive-thru could provide healthy, organic meals for commuters at the same speed as current fast food restaurants? 

			<br> <br> 

			With this question in mind, Dr. Parr went to work on designing an operating model that would allow a restaurant to obtain, prepare, and serve fresh, organic meals at a similar speed to current fast food options. After three months of planning and experimentation, Dr. Parr finally developed a highly efficient operating model which he coined the "Fast Fresh System". The system allowed customers to grab their orders, pay, and head for their destination in under 2 minutes, leading to the creation of Grab n'.
